# Sumerian - English Machine Translation (GSoC - 2020)
As part of the MTAAC project, the organization host Sumerian data comprising 1.5 million transliteration lines and 10K parallel lines corpus (approx). We already developed a neural network-based encode-decoder architecture for English-Sumerian Machine Translation, but that leverages the parallel dataset only, which is not sufficient to achieve state of the art results. Your task is to develop a language model using the monolingual data as well as parallel data to translate Sumerian phrases to English, and vice versa.

## Possible Mentors:
1. Niko Schenk
2. Ravneet Punia

### Link for the Dataset: TODO

## Your Tasks & Desired (Minimum) Outcomes:
Train and evaluate different models and architectures on standard train/development/test splits.
Experiment with all possible hyperparameter settings to obtain the best performance.
Perform a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the translations.
Better accuracy than the previous year model.
Testing different at least two NMT approaches like Cross-lingual Language Model, Dual Learning or Back-Translation.
Students with a research background will be preferred.

## Getting started:
1. [Cross-lingual Language Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.07291.pdf)
2. [Dual Learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6469-dual-learning-for-machine-translation)
3. Back-Translation for Unsupervised NMT
