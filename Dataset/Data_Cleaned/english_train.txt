When Enlil
life
and longevity ,
crown and tiara ,
a scepter of long days ,
the throne of kingship
with a secure foundation ,
years of abundance ,
a flood of weapons
which cast forth great fearsomeness ,
the royal ankara-weapon
the weapon of war ,
the weapon of heroism ,

covers the rebel lands
from across
the Lower Sea

All the great mountain ranges ,

the king nominated by An ,
bowing down at his feet ,

the lord through whose command
all is created ,
his king chosen by ( his ) sacred heart ,
had given ( this ) to him —
At that time
Šimaški ,

came forth .
Their kings
with their war and battle
confronted him .
by the power of Enlil
and by the command of Ninlil ,
his beloved mistress ,
in those wars and battles
he was repeatedly victorious .
Their head warriors
he mowed down .
Their runners
he weakened ( ? ) .
Their strong and weak
he killed like dogs .
The heads of their righteous and treacherous ones ( alike )
he strewed like seeds .
Their human corpses
he piled up like sheaves .
All their lords and enthroned ones
he took into capitivity .
All the great governors
of the territories
of Zabšali
all the governors
of the cites
whom he had brought back from the wars ,
their governors and enthroned ones
when he had taken them prisoner ,
before Enlil
he did …
The young men
who from the grasp of battle
had fallen out ,
and to their cities
like ( fleeing ) birds had saved their lives ,
did not escape his hand .
Towards their cities
like an Anzu-eagle he himself
screeched .
Their settled cities and towns
he made into ruined mounds ,
and their walls
he demolished .
The young men of their cities
which he had conquered
he removed their eyes ,
and in the orchards of Enlil
in the orchards of the great gods
he made them into domestic servants .
Further , the young women
of those cities
in the weaving-houses
the temples of the great gods
he offered as gifts .
Their cattle , sheep , goats and donkeys
which he brought in
and in the temples of Enlil
he sacrificed them .
Gold and silver
and things fashioned ( from them )
into big sacks
he filled .
Copper ,
and tin ,
bronze ,
and things fashioned from them
he tied onto the backs of donkeys ,
and for the temples of Enlil ,
into treasures
he made them .
given supreme power
that from this day foreward
the praise of them
should not fall from the lips ,
but should ( rather ) be handed down -
in the land of Šimaški ,
like …
he cast down .
The population ,
females and males ,
those living beings having names
he … with weapons .
He having revealed it to …

and power
shall unto distant times

… Habūra
Mardama
the king and shepherd of the Black-Headed Folk

and covered them with the garment of it .
to mine
he set them ( to work ) .
At that time ,
the gold
of Šimaški ,
which he had made into booty ,
into ( this ) stone figure of himself
he fashioned ,
and to Enlil ,
A person who an order of wickedness
shall issue against it ,
and this inscription
shall erase
and his own name
shall write upon it ,
or that which I have fashioned
he shall destroy ,
that person
may Enlil ,
